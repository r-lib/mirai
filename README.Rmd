### ミライ
<br />
みらい  未来
<br /><br />
Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R
<br /><br />
→ Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously in a parallel process, locally or distributed over the network.

→ Modern networking and concurrency, built on [nanonext](https://github.com/r-lib/nanonext/) and [NNG](https://nng.nanomsg.org/) (Nanomsg Next Gen), ensures reliable and efficient scheduling over fast inter-process communications or TCP/IP secured by TLS.
Distributed computing can launch remote resources via SSH or cluster managers.

→ A queued architecture readily handles more tasks than available processes, requiring no storage on the file system.
Innovative features include event-driven promises, asynchronous parallel map, and automatic serialization of otherwise non-exportable reference objects.
<br /><br />

### Quick Start

Use `mirai()` to evaluate an expression asynchronously in a separate, clean R process.

The following mimics an expensive calculation that eventually returns a vector of random values.
```{r}
#| label: exec
library(mirai)

m <- mirai(
  {
    Sys.sleep(n)
    rnorm(n, mean)
  },
  n = 3L,
  mean = 7
)
```
> The mirai expression is evaluated in another process and hence must be self-contained, not referring to variables that do not already exist there. Above, the variables `n` and `mean` are passed as part of the `mirai()` call.

A 'mirai' object is returned immediately, and is always non-blocking.
```{r}
#| label: do
m

# Whilst async operation still ongoing:
m$data
unresolved(m)
```
To wait for and collect the return value, use the mirai's `[]` method.
```{r}
#| label: call
m[]
```
As a mirai represents an async operation, it is never necessary to wait for it. Once it completes, the return value is automatically available at `$data`.
```{r}
#| label: resolv
while (unresolved(m)) {
  # Do other work
}
m$data
```

#### Daemons

📡️️ [Daemons](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v1-daemons.html#local-daemons) are persistent background processes for receiving mirai requests, and are created as easily as:

```{r}
#| label: daemons
daemons(6)
```

Daemons may also be deployed [remotely](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v1-daemons.html#remote-daemons) for distributed computing over the network.

🛰️️ [Launchers](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v1-daemons.html#launching-remote-daemons) can start daemons via (tunnelled) SSH or a cluster resource manager.

🔐 [Secure TLS connections](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v1-daemons.html#tls-secure-connections) can be used for remote daemon connections, with zero configuration required.

#### Async Parallel Map

`mirai_map()` maps a function over a list or vector, with each element processed in a separate parallel process.

For a dataframe or matrix, it automatically performs multiple map over the rows.

```{r}
#| label: map
df <- data.frame(
  fruit = c("melon", "grapes", "coconut"),
  price = c(3L, 5L, 2L)
)
m <- mirai_map(
  df,
  \(...) sprintf("%s: $%d", ...)
)
```
A 'mirai_map' object is returned immediately, and is always non-blocking.

Its value may be retrieved at any time using its `[]` method, returning a list just like `purrr::map()`.
The `[]` method also provides options for flatmap, early stopping and/or progress indicators. 
```{r}
#| label: mapvalue
m
m[.flat]
```

> All errors are returned as 'errorValues', facilitating recovery from partial failure. There are further [advantages](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v2-map.html) over alternative map implementations.

### Design Concepts

mirai is designed from the ground up to provide a production-grade experience.

→ Fast

- 1,000x more responsive vs. common alternatives [<sup>[1]</sup>](https://github.com/r-lib/mirai/pull/142#issuecomment-2457589563)
- Built for low-latency applications e.g. real time inference & Shiny apps

→ Reliable

- No reliance on global options or variables for consistent behaviour
- Explicit evaluation for transparent and predictable results

→ Scalable

- Launch millions of tasks over thousands of connections
- Proven track record for heavy-duty workloads in the life sciences industry

### Powering the Ecosystem

mirai features the following core integrations, with usage examples in the linked vignettes:

[<img alt="R parallel" src="https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.png" width="40" height="31" />](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v5-parallel.html) &nbsp; Provides the first official alternative communications backend for R, implementing a new parallel cluster type, a feature request by R-Core at R Project Sprint 2023.

[<img alt="purrr" src="https://purrr.tidyverse.org/logo.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://purrr.tidyverse.org) &nbsp; Powers the (in development) implementation of parallel map for the purrr functional programming toolkit, one of the core tidyverse packages.

[<img alt="promises" src="https://solutions.posit.co/images/brand/posit-icon-fullcolor.svg" width="40" height="36" />](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v3-promises.html) &nbsp; Implements the next generation of completely event-driven promises.
'mirai' and 'mirai_map' objects may be used interchangeably with 'promises', including with the promise pipe `%...>%`.

[<img alt="Shiny" src="https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/raw/main/man/figures/logo.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v3-promises.html) &nbsp; Asynchronous parallel / distributed backend, supporting the next level of responsiveness and scalability within Shiny, with native support for ExtendedTask.

[<img alt="Plumber" src="https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/images/logo-plumber.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v3-promises.html) &nbsp; Asynchronous parallel / distributed backend for scaling Plumber applications in production.

[<img alt="torch" src="https://torch.mlverse.org/css/images/hex/torch.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v4-serialization.html) &nbsp; Allows Torch tensors and complex objects such as models and optimizers to be used seamlessly across parallel processes.

[<img alt="Arrow" src="https://arrow.apache.org/img/arrow-logo_hex_black-txt_white-bg.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v4-serialization.html) &nbsp; Allows queries using the Apache Arrow format to be handled seamlessly over ADBC database connections hosted in background processes.

[<img alt="targets" src="https://github.com/ropensci/targets/raw/main/man/figures/logo.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) &nbsp; Targets, a make-like pipeline tool, has adopted crew as its default high-performance computing backend.
Crew is a distributed worker-launcher extending mirai to different distributed computing platforms, from traditional clusters including LFS, PBS/TORQUE, SGE and Slurm to cloud services such as AWS Batch.
