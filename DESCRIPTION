Description: Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression
    asynchronously in a parallel process, locally or distributed over the
    network. The result is automatically available upon completion. Modern
    networking and concurrency, built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg
    Next Gen), ensures reliable and efficient scheduling over fast
    inter-process communications or TCP/IP secured by TLS. Distributed
    computing can launch remote resources via SSH or cluster managers. An
    inherently queued architecture handles many more tasks than available
    processes, and requires no storage on the file system. Innovative
    features include support for otherwise non-exportable reference
    objects, event-driven promises, and asynchronous parallel map.
