Title: Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R
Version: 2.2.0.9000
Description: Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression
    asynchronously in a parallel process, locally or distributed over the
    network. The result is automatically available upon completion. Modern
    networking and concurrency, built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next
    Gen), ensures reliable and efficient scheduling over fast inter-process
    communications or TCP/IP secured by TLS. Distributed computing can launch
    remote resources via SSH or cluster managers. An inherently queued
    architecture handles many more tasks than available processes, and requires
    no storage on the file system. Innovative features include support for
    otherwise non-exportable reference objects, event-driven promises, and
    asynchronous parallel map.
