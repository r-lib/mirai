Description: Evaluates R expressions asynchronously and in parallel,
    locally or distributed across networks. An official parallel cluster
    type for R. Built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG', its non-polling,
    event-driven architecture scales from a laptop to thousands of
    processes across high-performance computing clusters and cloud
    platforms.  Features FIFO scheduling with task cancellation, promises
    for reactive programming, 'OpenTelemetry' distributed tracing, and
    custom serialization for cross-language data types.
