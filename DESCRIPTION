Description: Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression
    asynchronously, locally or distributed over the network. Built on
    'nanonext' and 'NNG' for modern networking and concurrency, scales
    efficiently to millions of tasks over thousands of parallel processes.
    Provides optimal scheduling over fast 'IPC', TCP, and TLS connections,
    integrating with SSH or cluster managers. Implements event-driven
    promises for reactive programming, and supports custom serialization
    for cross-language data types.
