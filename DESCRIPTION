Title: Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R
Version: 1.2.0.9019
Description: Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression
    asynchronously in a parallel process, locally or distributed over the
    network, with the result automatically available upon completion. Modern
    networking and concurrency built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen)
    ensure reliable and efficient scheduling, over fast inter-process
    communications or TCP/IP secured by TLS. Features built-in queueing to
    handle many more tasks than available processes, no storage on the file
    system, support for otherwise non-exportable reference objects, an
    event-driven promises implementation, and asynchronous parallel map.
