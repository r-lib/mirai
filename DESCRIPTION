Description: Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression
    asynchronously in a parallel process, locally or distributed over the
    network. Modern networking and concurrency, built on 'nanonext' and
    'NNG', ensures reliable scheduling over fast inter-process
    communications or TCP/IP secured by TLS.  Launch remote resources via
    SSH or cluster managers for distributed computing. The queued
    architecture scales efficiently to millions of tasks over thousands of
    connections, requiring no storage on the file system.  Innovative
    features include event-driven promises, asynchronous parallel map, and
    seamless serialization of otherwise non-exportable reference objects.
