### ミライ

  
みらい 未来  
  
Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R  
  

→ Run R code in parallel while keeping your session free

→ Scale seamlessly from your laptop to cloud servers or HPC clusters

→ Automate actions as soon as tasks complete

  

### Installation

``` r
install.packages("mirai")
```

### Quick Start

[`mirai()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/mirai.md) evaluates an
R expression asynchronously in a parallel process.

[`daemons()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/daemons.md) sets up
persistent background processes for parallel computations.

``` r
library(mirai)
daemons(5)

m <- mirai({
  Sys.sleep(1)
  100 + 42
})

mp <- mirai_map(1:9, \(x) {
  Sys.sleep(1)
  x^2
})

m
#> < mirai [] >
m[]
#> [1] 142

mp
#> < mirai map [4/9] >
mp[.flat]
#> [1]  1  4  9 16 25 36 49 64 81

daemons(0)
```

### Design Philosophy

→ **Dynamic Architecture**

- Inverted topology, where daemons connect to host, enables true dynamic
  scaling
- Optimal load balancing through efficient FIFO dispatcher scheduling
- Event-driven promises complete with zero latency (and no polling
  overhead)

→ **Modern Foundation**

- Built on [NNG](https://nng.nanomsg.org/) via
  [nanonext](https://nanonext.r-lib.org/), scales reliably to millions
  of tasks / thousands of processes
- High performance, with round-trip times measured in microseconds, not
  milliseconds
- Native support for IPC, TCP, and zero-config TLS with automatic
  certificate generation

→ **Production First**

- Clear evaluation model with explicit dependencies prevents surprises
  from hidden state
- Serialization support for cross-language data formats (torch tensors,
  Arrow tables)
- OpenTelemetry integration for observability across distributed
  processes

→ **Deploy Everywhere**

- Local, network / cloud (via SSH, SSH tunnelling) or HPC (via Slurm,
  SGE, PBS, LSF)
- Modular compute profiles direct tasks to the most suitable resources
- Combine local, remote, and HPC resources in a single compute profile

### Powers the R Ecosystem

mirai serves as a foundation for asynchronous, parallel and distributed
computing in the R ecosystem.

shaping development of the package, from initiating the original request
for persistent daemons, through to orchestrating robustness testing for
the high performance computing requirements of crew and targets.

method to work seamlessly within Shiny, and prototyping event-driven
promises.

on L’Ecuyer-CMRG streams to ensure statistical independence in parallel
processing, and reviewing mirai’s implementation as the first
‘alternative communications backend for R’.
