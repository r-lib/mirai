# Daemons (Set Persistent Processes)

Set daemons, or persistent background processes, to receive
[`mirai()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/mirai.md) requests.
Specify `n` to create daemons on the local machine. Specify `url` to
receive connections from remote daemons (for distributed computing
across the network). Specify `remote` to optionally launch remote
daemons via a remote configuration. Dispatcher (enabled by default)
ensures optimal scheduling.

## Usage

``` r
daemons(
  n,
  url = NULL,
  remote = NULL,
  dispatcher = TRUE,
  ...,
  sync = FALSE,
  seed = NULL,
  serial = NULL,
  tls = NULL,
  pass = NULL,
  .compute = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- n:

  (integer) number of daemons to launch.

- url:

  (character) URL at which to listen for daemon connections, e.g.
  'tcp://hostname:5555'. Use scheme 'tls+tcp://' for secure TLS
  connections (see Distributed Computing section).
  [`host_url()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/host_url.md) may
  be used to construct a valid URL.

- remote:

  (configuration) for launching remote daemons, generated by
  [`ssh_config()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/ssh_config.md),
  [`cluster_config()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/cluster_config.md),
  or
  [`remote_config()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/remote_config.md).

- dispatcher:

  (logical) whether to use dispatcher for optimal FIFO scheduling. See
  Dispatcher section below.

- ...:

  (daemon arguments) passed to
  [`daemon()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/daemon.md) when
  launching daemons. Includes `asyncdial`, `autoexit`, `cleanup`,
  `output`, `maxtasks`, `idletime`, `walltime`, and `tlscert`.

- sync:

  (logical) whether to evaluate mirai synchronously in the current
  process for testing and debugging. When `TRUE`, other arguments except
  `seed` and `.compute` are disregarded.

- seed:

  (integer) for reproducible random number generation. `NULL` (default)
  initializes L'Ecuyer-CMRG RNG streams per daemon (statistically sound,
  non-reproducible). An integer value instead initializes a stream per
  mirai (experimental), allowing reproducible results independent of
  which daemon evaluates it.

- serial:

  (configuration) for custom serialization of reference objects (e.g.
  Arrow Tables, torch tensors), created by
  [`serial_config()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/serial_config.md).
  Requires dispatcher. `NULL` applies any configurations from
  [`register_serial()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/register_serial.md).

- tls:

  (character) for secure TLS connections. Either a file path to
  PEM-encoded TLS certificate (possibly followed by other certificates
  in a validation chain) and private key, or a length-2 vector of
  (certificate, private key). `NULL` auto-generates single-use
  credentials.

- pass:

  (function) returning the password for an encrypted `tls` private key.
  Use a function rather than a direct value for security.

- .compute:

  (character) name of the compute profile. Each profile has its own
  independent set of daemons. `NULL` (default) uses the 'default'
  profile.

## Value

Invisibly, logical `TRUE` when creating daemons and `FALSE` when
resetting.

## Details

Use `daemons(0)` to reset daemon connections:

- All connected daemons and/or dispatchers exit automatically.

- Any as yet unresolved 'mirai' will return an 'errorValue' 19
  (Connection reset).

- [`mirai()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/mirai.md) reverts to
  the default behaviour of creating a new background process for each
  request.

If the host session ends, all connected dispatcher and daemon processes
automatically exit as soon as their connections are dropped.

Calling `daemons()` implicitly resets any existing daemons for the
compute profile with `daemons(0)`. Instead,
[`launch_local()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/launch_local.md)
or
[`launch_remote()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/launch_local.md)
may be used to add daemons at any time without resetting daemons.

## Local Daemons

Setting daemons, or persistent background processes, is typically more
efficient as it removes the need for, and overhead of, creating new
processes for each mirai evaluation. It also provides control over the
total number of processes at any one time.

Supply the argument `n` to set the number of daemons. New background
[`daemon()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/daemon.md) processes
are automatically launched on the local machine connecting back to the
host process, either directly or via dispatcher.

## Dispatcher

By default `dispatcher = TRUE` launches a background process running
[`dispatcher()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/dispatcher.md).
Dispatcher connects to daemons on behalf of the host, queues tasks, and
ensures optimal FIFO scheduling. Dispatcher also enables (i) mirai
cancellation using
[`stop_mirai()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/stop_mirai.md) or
when using a `.timeout` argument to
[`mirai()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/mirai.md), and (ii)
the use of custom serialization configurations.

With `dispatcher = FALSE`, daemons connect directly to the host and
tasks are distributed round-robin, with tasks queued at each daemon.
Optimal scheduling is not guaranteed, as tasks can queue at one daemon
while others remain idle. However, this is the most lightweight option,
suited to similar-length tasks or when concurrent tasks do not exceed
available daemons.

## Distributed Computing

Specify `url` as a character string to allow tasks to be distributed
across the network (`n` is only required in this case if also providing
a launch configuration to `remote`).

The host / dispatcher listens at this URL, utilising a single port, and
[`daemon()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/daemon.md) processes
dial in to this URL. Host / dispatcher automatically adjusts to the
number of daemons actually connected, allowing dynamic upscaling /
downscaling.

The URL should have a 'tcp://' scheme, such as 'tcp://10.75.32.70:5555'.
Switching the URL scheme to 'tls+tcp://' automatically upgrades the
connection to use TLS. The auxiliary function
[`host_url()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/host_url.md) may be
used to construct a valid host URL based on the computer's IP address.

IPv6 addresses are also supported and must be enclosed in square
brackets `[]` to avoid confusion with the final colon separating the
port. For example, port 5555 on the IPv6 loopback address ::1 would be
specified as 'tcp://\[::1\]:5555'.

Specifying the wildcard value zero for the port number e.g.
'tcp://\[::1\]:0' will automatically assign a free ephemeral port. Use
[`status()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/status.md) to inspect
the actual assigned port at any time.

Specify `remote` with a call to
[`ssh_config()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/ssh_config.md),
[`cluster_config()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/cluster_config.md)
or
[`remote_config()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/remote_config.md)
to launch (programatically deploy) daemons on remote machines, from
where they dial back to `url`. If not launching daemons,
[`launch_remote()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/launch_local.md)
may be used to generate the shell commands for manual deployment.

## Compute Profiles

If `NULL`, the `"default"` compute profile is used. Providing a
character value for `.compute` creates a new compute profile with the
name specified. Each compute profile retains its own daemons settings
and operates independently. Some usage examples follow:

**local / remote** daemons may be set by specifying a host URL and
`.compute` as `"remote"`, creating a new compute profile. Subsequent
[`mirai()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/mirai.md) calls may
then be sent for local computation by not specifying the `.compute`
argument, or for remote computation to connected daemons by specifying
the `.compute` argument as `"remote"`.

**cpu / gpu** some tasks may require access to different types of
daemon, such as those with GPUs. In this case, `daemons()` may be called
to set up host URLs for CPU-only daemons and for those with GPUs,
specifying the `.compute` argument as `"cpu"` and `"gpu"` respectively.
By supplying the `.compute` argument to subsequent
[`mirai()`](https://mirai.r-lib.org/dev/reference/mirai.md) calls, tasks
may be sent to either `cpu` or `gpu` daemons as appropriate.

Note: further actions such as resetting daemons via `daemons(0)` should
be carried out with the desired `.compute` argument specified.

with_daemons("sync", {
  m <- mirai(Sys.getpid())
})
daemons(0, .compute = "sync")
