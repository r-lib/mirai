\title{mirai: Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R}
\description{
\emph{moving already} \cr \cr
Evaluates R expressions asynchronously and in parallel, locally or
distributed across networks. An official parallel cluster type for R. Built
on 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Generation), its non-polling,
event-driven architecture scales from a laptop to thousands of processes
across HPC clusters and cloud platforms. Features FIFO scheduling with task
cancellation, promises for reactive programming, 'OpenTelemetry' distributed
tracing, and custom serialization for cross-language data types.

\section{Notes}{


For local mirai requests, the default transport for inter-process
communications is platform-dependent: abstract Unix domain sockets on Linux,
Unix domain sockets on MacOS, Solaris and other POSIX platforms, and named
pipes on Windows.

This may be overriden, if desired, by specifying 'url' in the \code{\link[=daemons]{daemons()}}
interface and launching daemons using \code{\link[=launch_local]{launch_local()}}.

\section{OpenTelemetry}{


mirai provides comprehensive OpenTelemetry tracing support for observing
asynchronous operations and distributed computation. Please refer to the
OpenTelemetry vignette for further details:
